# Changelog

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Fix `KeyError` for `force_mode` when `data_type` is missing (PR #3 by @openschwall).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Remove redundant `_write_config_to_batteries()` call during options flow. The function opened a second Modbus TCP connection while the coordinator was still holding the first one, causing "Not connected" errors on V3 batteries. The reload already applies all configuration values via `async_setup_entry()`.
- Fix `async_close()` in Modbus client attempting to `await` the synchronous `close()` method, which caused "object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression" errors on every reload.
- Fix "Unable to remove unknown job listener" error on reload by switching `homeassistant_started` listener from `async_listen_once` to `async_listen`. The one-time listener auto-removed itself after firing, causing `async_on_unload` to fail when trying to cancel it during reload.
- Run startup consumption backfill immediately on reload instead of waiting for `homeassistant_started` (which never fires again after boot).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- Remove V3-exclusive entity definitions to match V2 register footprint.
- Deleted 20 entity definitions from the V3 definition lists (sensors, binary sensors, selects, buttons) that had no equivalent in V2.
- This reduces V3 Modbus-polled registers from ~38 to ~22, which should significantly cut options flow reload time for V3 users.
